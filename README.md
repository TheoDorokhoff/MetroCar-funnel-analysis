![taxi-service-logo-illustration-vector](https://github.com/TheoDorokhoff/MetroCar-funnel-analysis/assets/144614675/71628dbb-511f-4c3b-9652-4975320c2a1a)


In our comprehensive funnel analysis of the Metrocar app user journey, we pinpointed crucial areas for optimization. The ride completion stage stood out with an alarming 50% drop-off rate, becoming a primary focus for research and improvement. Notable insights include the dominance of iOS in absolute numbers, signaling the need for increased marketing efforts to boost the web platform audience. While users aged 35-44 are the most prevalent, the 18-24 age group boasts the highest conversion rates across acceptance, completion, and payment stages, making both age categories prime target demographics. The data supports implementing surge pricing during peak hours, particularly in the 8-9 AM and 4-7 PM time slots, which exhibit the highest ride request rates. However, the ride completion stage faces challenges, potentially attributed to low average driver ratings, extended wait times, and intense competition during peak hours.
